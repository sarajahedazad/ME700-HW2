## Instructions on how to use the code
Put all the .py files in the src folder and run one of the examples.        
**Note 1: The solver and interpolation plots were impelemted using chatGPT. In the future version, that will be changed.**   
**Note 2: Tests will be added in the future version.**  
**Note 3: I think I am getting incorrect results for the critical load. Opinions on how to construct Kg will be appreciated.**
