# ME700-HW2
**Important note:** This repository is a work in progress and not in its final version.

## Instructions on how to use the code
Two examples of how to use the code are provided in the `example1.py` and `example2.py` files. Please ensure that all the `.py` files in this repository are located in the same folder as `example1.py` and `example2.py` so that the examples run correctly.      
**Note 1: The solver and interpolation plots were impelemted using chatGPT. In the future version, that will be changed.**   
**Note 2: Tests will be added in the future version.**  
**Note 3: I think I am getting incorrect results for the critical load. Opinions on how to construct Kg will be appreciated.**
